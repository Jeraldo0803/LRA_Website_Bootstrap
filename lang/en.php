Father Antonio rushed to look for materials from the ruins of Manila, while the Chinese Catholics contributed generously to the project. After six months of “unremitting toil and sweat” the new church and convent were ready to be blessed. Msgr. Manuel Prat OP, Vicar Apostolic of Amoy (China), presided over the ceremony on 28 October 1945.",

Build us a school!” Even though he felt at that moment “almost totally drained of physical energies,” he did not desist from his plan.",
